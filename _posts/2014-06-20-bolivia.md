## Summary
Bolivia received a 0.86 overall score, placing it 19th among 26 Climatescope nations. It was one of six Climatescope countries that neither gained nor lost ground in the 2013 rankings. Bolivia is South America’s largest natural gas exporter and relied on the fuel for approximately 53% of its electricity generation in 2012.
Bolivia saw no growth in clean energy investment or deployment from 2011 to 2012 and its prospects for foreign investment could be impacted by recent nationalization developments.
Renewables have an 18.6% share of Bolivia’s total generation capacity thanks primarily to the presence of significant small hydro capacity. The country ranks sixth among all Climatescope nations in the clean energy share-of-generation indicator, placing it ahead of Brazil and Chile, among others.
Bolivia has the region’s third most vibrant green microfinance sector, as determined by the percentage of microfinance institutions offering some type of green financial product. Microfinance is positioned to have a central role in bringing clean distributed generation to rural Bolivia; the country lags other Latin American and Caribbean nations in the proportion of residents served by the grid.
